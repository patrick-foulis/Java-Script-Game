# Java-Script-Game

This was a personal project that I completed over Christmas Break 2023. I followed a set of guidelines for the project set by Free Code Camp. The design of the actual game itself was done for me, however the implementation of the project was done by myself. As a future goal, I would like to enhance the User Interface of the game to make it look more modern. However, the main focus of this project was for the practice of JavaScript fundamentals.
